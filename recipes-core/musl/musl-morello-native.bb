DESCRIPTION = " That is right, we have a native libc sysroot that is needed as an intermediate step \
to provide crt and compiler-rt that will be used by the cross compiler, this recipe exist to avoid having \
a native recipe dependant on a target recipe... which is actually the case, but there you go. Note that the \
libc sysroot is NOT actually native, it is just a trick."
